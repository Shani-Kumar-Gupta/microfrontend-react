1. What is Microfrontend?
  - Microfrontend is an architectural design pattern for software architecture which focuses on the front end layer.
  - Divide a monolithic app into multiple, smaller apps
  - Each smaller app is responsible for a distinct feature of the product.
  - It's breakdown a monolithic front-end application into smaller, loosely coupled and independently deployable components.

2. Why use them?
  - Multiple engineering teams can work in isolation
  - Each smaller app is easier to understand and make changes to

3. Monolithic vs Microfrontend
  - Development and Deployment
    -(Monolithic): Tightly Coupled
    -(Microfrontend): Loosely Coupled - Independent development & deployment
  - Scalability
    -(Monolithic): Limited Scalability
    -(Microfrontend): Targeted Scalability based on component needs
  - Technology Flexibility
  - Team Collaboration
  - Release Cycle
  - User experience
  - Maintenance and Upgrades
  - Security
    -(Monolithic): Single Point of failure
    -(Microfrontend): Improved security & isolation between components

4. Implementation (Orchestration or Arrangement or Integration) Strategies:
  - Composition at Build Time (Compile Time Integration)
  - Composition at Run Time (Client Side Integration) - Webpack Module Federation
  - Composition at Server
  - Communication and Data Sharing Among Micro frontends
  - Routing and Navigation Approach
  - State Management Considerations
